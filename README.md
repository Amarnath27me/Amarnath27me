## 🚀 About Me

Data-driven professional passionate about turning messy data into strategic insight.
Currently building real-world data analytics and data engineering skills through hands-on projects — from data pipelines and warehouses to SQL and Python-based analysis. Strong focus on practical, clean code and solving business-relevant problems. Actively learning modern analytics tooling and engineering best practices.

🔍 What I do:
• Build end-to-end data solutions — ETL/ELT pipelines, data modeling & analytics
• Analyze and visualize datasets to uncover meaningful patterns
• Write clean, reproducible code in Python, SQL, and notebook environments
• Continuously improve with new tools & industry standards

💡 I’m driven by impact — not just completion. My work reflects careful thought about the problem, methodology, and results achieved.
